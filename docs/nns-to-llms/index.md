# From Neural Networks to Large Language Models

My notes to help me understand Neural Networks to LLMs from scratch.

## To-Do

- [ ] What are Neural Networks?
    - [ ] The most basic decision making model.
    - [ ] Activation Functions and their magic.
    - [ ] The importance of weights and how to they influence.
- [ ] Building learnable neural network from scratch.
- [ ] Understanding Text Representation and Feature Extraction
    - [ ] Bag of Words, TF-IDF, Word Embeddings (Word2Vec, GloVe):
    - [ ] Understanding Word2Vec and its implementation
    - [ ] Understanding Text Classification (Naive Bayes, SVM, Neural Networks)
- [ ] Sequence learning models
    - [ ] Introduction to RNNs and LSTMs
- [ ] Chapter on how attention was introduced in 2014 (way before 2017 paper).
