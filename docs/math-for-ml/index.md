# Mathematics for Machine Learning and Deep Learning

This section contains mathematical algorithms, methods, theorems, and proofs that are borrowed by Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL), or were intended to be general-purpose solutions and now find their use in ML and DL. 

You might be surprised to learn that many optimization methods used in ML/DL date back several decades in the field of mathematics. This section is particularly exciting as it helps us appreciate the fundamental essence of math in ML/DL.
